    <h2>How we share information</h2>
    <p>We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With other users of the same property (owners/managers and tenants) as required to provide the Service (for example, lease details and maintenance requests shared with the property manager).</li>
      <li>With service providers and partners who process data on our behalf (payment processors, hosting, analytics).</li>
      <li>To comply with legal processes, respond to lawful requests, or protect rights, safety or property.</li>
      <li>In connection with a business transfer (merger, sale of assets) — we will notify users if their personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data retention & security</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. However, no system is completely secure — if you believe your account has been compromised contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:supercosition@gmail.com">supercosition@gmail.com</a>.</p>

If your app targets children or includes features for children, you must follow Google Play policies and local laws.</p>
